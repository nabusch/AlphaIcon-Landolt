The scripts contained in this repository aim to reproduce a preexisting set of MATLAB functions implementing a psychometric
adaptive staircase procedure. The theory behind is well described in the work by Baek & colleagues (2016) "qPR: An adaptive partial-report procedure based on Bayesian inference"

The article comes with a set of MATLAB functions that here I aim to reproduce.

The package is at the moment of the writing (28 Jan 2019) in a beta version, and still lacks proper documentation. For this reason I discourage usage for the time being.
